Now:\n\nâ€¢ Ambiguity in relationships has been eliminated, and JOINs have been explicitly adjusted.\nâ€¢ It has been validated that plans are generated correctly after selecting a student.\nâ€¢ The system now only attempts to load plans **once the student has been chosen**.\n\nðŸ§© Recommendation: ensure a student is always selected before invoking loading or summary functions. Implement preventive validations in the UI flow to avoid premature loading attempts."
